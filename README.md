# Q-paper-generator

This is a Question Paper generator application built using Node.js by Faizan Khan.


The user can generate a random Question paper by entering two fields,the "Total Marks" and "percentage distribution" of the two difficulties, thus the 
third is machine calculated.


This contains a data set of questions consisting of more 100 questions to handle various percantage distributions that the user can give 
and can generate a question paper of upto 200 marks.

The percantage distribution is categorised into [Easy, Medium and Hard].

A sample question paper is also attached in this repo for a total marks of 50 and distribution as Easy-40%, Medium-40% and Hard-20%.

The application makes use of an open source library 'pdfkit' to generate the pdf. 

You can test this application by cloning this repo into your local machine and installing the dependancies along. 
You can run the index.js file using "node index.js" command or by installing "nodemon" and entering the inputs which are subsequently asked thereby.

And a question paper in pdf format will be generated adhering to the total marks and percentage distribution entered by the user.
